## Yelp Photo Classification Task

We need to predict the labels describing the business attributes of restaurants from the user submitted pictures. This is a Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) classification problem. Each photo is assigned a business id and each business id is assigned multiple labels as given below.
The problem was launched as Kaggle competition. [10]
