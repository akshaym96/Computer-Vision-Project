## Yelp Photo Classification Task

We need to predict the labels describing the business attributes of restaurants from the user submitted pictures. This is a Multi-Instance Multi-Label (MIML) classification problem. Each photo is assigned a business id and each business id is assigned multiple labels as given below.
The problem was launched as Kaggle competition. [10]

The original dataset contains nearly 2.3 lakh images taken by the users. Each photo is assigned a id called photoID. Each photoID is mapped to a businessID and each of the businessID is assigned multiple labels as shown in the figure above.

The different labels are listed below:
0: good_for_lunch
1: good_for_dinner
2: takes_reservations
3: outdoor_seating
4: restaurant_is_expensive
5: has_alcohol
6: has_table_service
7: ambience_is_classy
8: good_for_kids

### Method -1 SIFT, Random Forest


In this method, features for both train and test images were extracted using SIFT. Then these descriptors were used to build clusters using K-Means. The clusters from K-Means are used to build the histograms for the train and test images. The extracted histograms are fed to 9 Random Forest Classifier for training and testing one 9 different available labels.

Feature Extraction time:-
- Train Images:-   15 hours 37 minutes 37 seconds
- Test Images:-     1 hour 22 minutes 26 secs.
- K-means clustering :-  3 hours  7 minutes 48 secs.
- Training time:-  1 minute 34 secs.
- Testing Time:-  30.5867 secs.
Results:- 
Accuracy:-
Strict Match:-  36.7031 %
One Mismatch:-  40.8372%
Two Mismatch:-  51.2016%
